RE: finding out how the "Find Controller" feature works

The nintendo switch, as of (9/13/2017) seems to have some bugs in the "find controller" feature
This might also be because my fake-joycon hardware is returning all-zeros for some EEPROM reads still
Whatever the cause, the "Find Controllers" feature on the switch menu refused to let me into the actual
"find controllers" screen while my fake-joycon was paired, and both real-joycons were attached to the sides of 
the console.

{editors note: I thought about it, it might be possible that Im accidentally telling the switch that I am physically
connected to it instead of communicating over bluetooth. so even though the console knows the fake-joycon is connected, it also thinks
that it is *physically* connected, even though that would mean 3 joycons are physically connected. Regardless of what the bug is,
way to go nintendo}

I was only able to activate "Find Controllers" by physically removing the right-hand joycon from the console.
Now the console is allowing me to find any one of the 3 controllers, 
- one real, attached L-joycon, which rumbles while attached to the console (?!)
- one real, detached R-joycon that rumbles
- my fake-joycon, which receives these messages (just a rumble pattern)
- **NOTE THIS IS FOR THE PRO CONTROLLER. JOYCON GETS DIFFERENT RUMBLE PATTERN **

Now for some tricks. If I hard-reset my fake-joycon, it will re-establish a previous paired connection with the switch on bootup.
It will go grey in the "Find" menu until it has reconnected, at which point it re-appears.

I changed the code so the fake-joycon will NOT reconnect on bootup. Now it remains grey in the menu, and when I click on it, the
player lights scan back and forth (on the find menu screen), as if it is "searching" for the controller. It however, never attempts to 
bluetooth-connect to the fake-joycon. It just searches forever. searching. searching.

I turned off the "power" on the disconnected R-joycon. (by  pressing the sync button) It also went grey in the "Find" menu. Now it 
also has the player lights scanning when I click on they grey icon. The switch never finds it either. It just "searches" forever, 
you cannoteven cancel the searching without exiting the "Find" menu.

I later found out this is because of a BUG: if you start searching for a joycon that for some reason will never reply, and then begin searching 
for a joycon that WILL reply, the first operation seemingling blocks forever and neither joycon will be found. Presumbably any
amount joycons after the first non-responder will not be found

Anyways, without having the fake-joycon connected, pressing the sync button on a detached joycon will turn off the green LED
and grey out the joycon in the menu. This appears to be the "power turning off" but I suspect that it is not. 
The reason is that if you click on the grey controller on the menu, it suddenly springs back to life!
But if you click on my fake joycon when it is grey/diconnected.... nothing ever happens, and no connection attempt is made.
So this is why I suspect that a greyed out joycon is actually just "suspended" and not actually off. It is maybe in a lower
power mode where it does not read the buttons or send any reports, but it remains connected and waits for a magic
report from the console?

Another reason I suspect this, is that if I simutaneously press the "sync" button on a real-joycon (to power it DOWN), and reboot my fake-joycon, 
they both go grey in the "Find" menu. However, when I leave the menu and come back, the fake-joycon has disappeared, 
but the real one is still there. meanwhile, nothing has attempted to connect to my fake-joycon. So it seems the sync button does not
power the joycon completely down. Which makes sense, the radio must at least have power for this to work.

I have many questions.

- does the bluetooth connection actually close down why you press sync? I assume it must at some point eventually, because if you sleep the console, 
normally disconnects the bt connection to the fake-joycon. However you can still "wake up" missing controllers using the "Find" menu. 
This would appear to be the console re-connecting over bluetooth.

- does the switch console reconnect to disconnected (but paired) joycons when it is trying to find them? How often? Why does it not try to 
connect to the fake-joycon then? 

- Or do the joycons initiate the connection?

- When something goes gray on the "Find" menu, can it do so in different ways? for eample, diconnection event, sleep message, etc?


So Im still scratching my head about how a greyed out controller can be awoken from the switch menu, as I have not been able to
a) make my fake-joycon appear grey on the menu while still being connected over bluetooth
b) receive any communication (connection attempt) from the console while NOT being connected over bluetooth

At least one of these things would have to happen. Or maybe a third thing? Im really not sure at this point. 



Again, it is very slightly possible something is working incorrectly because I have not returned valid data from the EEPROM reads when
I pair up ininitially.

For example, one thing that the EEPROM returns is the BDADDR of the joycon right? Well maybe if thats all 0's the switch wont 
have any hardware address to connect to, due to programming choices on their end.

thats all for today
